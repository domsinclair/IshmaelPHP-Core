# Ishmael PHP

![](ishmael.jpg)

Ishmael PHP is a lightweight, modular micro-framework for building HTTP-centric PHP applications. It emphasizes an explicit bootstrap process, a clean routing layer, a PSR-style middleware pipeline, and pragmatic, context-rich logging — all with a small, readable core that is easy to extend and test.

Highlights:
- Modular design with a simple application skeleton and discoverable modules.
- Request/Response flow inspired by PSR-7/PSR-15 with middleware-first composition.
- Sensible, file-based configuration with safe defaults.
- First-class logging (Monolog) including processors and per-request IDs for traceability.
- Minimal surface area: prefer clarity over magic so you can understand and control the runtime.
